answer 1..Web developers rely on an array of tools to design, develop, and maintain websites and web applications. Commonly used tools include text editors or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom. Version control systems like Git, along with platforms like GitHub or Bitbucket, facilitate collaborative coding and project management. Web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari are essential for testing and debugging code. Command-line interfaces (CLIs) such as Terminal on macOS or Command Prompt on Windows enable efficient execution of commands and scripts.

Frameworks and libraries like React.js, Angular, or jQuery streamline front-end development, while back-end frameworks such as Node.js, Express.js, or Django handle server-side logic. Database management systems like MySQL or MongoDB store and manage data, while tools like Postman or Insomnia aid in API development and testing.
